							<p>Becoming a software engineer has been many years in the making. Many people would fill these years with detailed statistics of education and programming 
                                accomplishments. For me it was a different route. Where I grew up advanced education was not a heavily discussed topic. Most of my peers worked on family 
                                farms or employed in a career in an agriculture trade. My passion was firefighting. </p>
							<p>I volunteered locally for several years while working on a Fire Science degree at the local junior college. I trained hard and studied everything I could 
                                get my hands on. I was hired by City of Modesto as a firefighter. Two lessons learned from that time have greatly affected my work ethic, not only in life, 
                                but directly applicable to software engineering. 1.) 'Attention to detail'. Everything had to be practiced and performed under the view of a microscope. 2.) 
                                'Improvise, Adapt, Overcome'. This phrase has been concreted into my head. Every emergency starts in chaos. Even with extensive training, we had to improvise 
                                with the data given us at the scene, adapt to the circumstances, and ultimately overcome to a successful outcome. </p>
                            <p>Firefighting as a career was short lived due to aggravating injuries. I was introduced into the financial world as a Financial Advisor. In my 10 years as 
                                an advisor, I worked with clients in preparing them for financial security. It was in this capacity that I learned my love for numbers, strategies, 
                                algorithms and developing client relationships. I held training seminars almost weekly where I presented educational lessons in understanding investment 
                                strategies and retirement preparation. With a Series 7 and 66 Securities license I studied heavily into the patterns and methods of stock market trading. 
                                Financial advising was a rewarding and profitable career but with the rise of COVID-19 and the changing political landscape surrounding the financial world 
                                I became uneasy with the vulnerability in the longevity of this career path. </p>
                            <p>My wife and I discussed the pros and cons of making a career change with children and how that would impact our family. After researching software engineering 
                                extensively, it was obvious that this was the path for us. For me it is important to be engaged in a work environment that challenges me, allows me to be 
                                strategic and creative. I have always been interested in the science of computers and how they function at their core. Knowing that computer science and 
                                software engineering will be a constant provides the stability and type of employment I am eager to be involved in. The greatest challenges we face are 
                                transitioning and rivaling other applicants with accredited degrees. To transition, we saved enough money to put my Security licenses on hold while I spent 
                                6 months in a coding camp and devoting 80+ hours a week to learning this new trade. I have found that I have learned enough to be competitive to most college 
                                graduates. Experience has taught me how to be the best software engineer one could hire. </p>
